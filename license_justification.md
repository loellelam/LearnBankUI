# Why is this project under the MIT License?

The MIT License is a great fit for this project because it emphasizes openness and accessibility, which are values that align with the educational purpose of LearnBankUI. This is ideal for small educational or open-source projects, where the main goal is to share knowledge rather than maintain strict control over the code. Since the program is designed to help beginners understand C++ concepts such as linked lists, memory management, and file I/O, the MIT License allows anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the code with minimal restrictions. This encourages learning, collaboration, and adaptation, enabling students and developers to build upon the project or integrate parts of it into their own work without legal trouble.
